- 👋 Hi, I’m @ramonawerner
- 👀 I’m interested in the interactions between trees and microorganisms, in particular mycorrhizae, and how they affect the resilience and health of our forests.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about communities of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, how to analyze their composition and structure and to link it to forest plantation performance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to participate in relevant research efforts investigating climate change impacts on forestry ecosystems and their role in mitigation effects.
